*Homework Assignment (Analyzing Distributions)*

Part 1:

Follow the “Histograms and Density Plots in Python” tutorial to figure out which airline is most likely to get you to your destination on time.
Download the data file (formatted_flights.csv) here
Tell us which airline you choose and why.

Part 2:

Use the same airline data to demonstrate (or disprove) the four aspects of the Central Limit Theorem (from Central Limit Theorem video).
Hint: take repeated random samples of a specific size and measure the mean and standard deviation of each one.
Graph your results. Does it look like a normal distribution?
How does sample size affect your results?
